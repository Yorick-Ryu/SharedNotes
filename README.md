## Essay

Hi guys! I am very happy to participate in the Kotlin Multiplatform contest. My English is not very
good, there can be grammatical errors or fuzzy phrases in this essay, pardon me.

### My Background

I am a junior from Nanjing, China, majoring in software engineering. I love new technology like
kotlin and that's why I found it and participated in this competition. New technology is very cool.
Absolutely android development is my favorite.

### Project Background

In our class, many students have the habit of taking class notes.

But when we wanted to share our notes with other classmates in real time, trouble came. We can't sit
together every time, and sometimes we must take online classes because of the COVID-19. It's also
not convenient to communicate using chat software like WeChat. For example, to show Markdown. So, I
developed Shared Notes, which is a note-taking application that supports real-time sharing, Markdown
syntax, and supports Android platform and Desktop platform (Windows, MacOS, Linux). Limited to my
hardware device, there is no iOS version now, but it is planned.

Depending on time and current personal skills, I have only developed clients for Android and
Desktop, which share the full data layer and 75% of the UI layer code. Both Android and desktop
platforms support responsive layouts to accommodate devices of different sizes.

Limited to time and personal current state of technology, I only developed Android and Desktop
clients, which fully share the data layer and share 75% of the interface layer code. Whether it's
Android or desktop, they all support responsive layouts to suit devices of different sizes.

### Brief introduction

The program consists of five modules: edition, notes, contacts, categories, and tags. Edition
involves editing and sharing your notes, supporting Markdown syntax and dual-screen preview. Notes
display notes there are shared by contacts in real time. Contacts may provide the function of
viewing and managing contacts (not implemented). And the feature of viewing and managing note
categories and tags (not implemented) is supplied by Categories and Tags.
